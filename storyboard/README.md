### Visual stage description - Experiment 2 :

Signals from two or many sources could be added up or subtracted using opamp configured as summer and subtractor. The signal source will be a variable regulated power supply and measurement could be done suitably. Signal addition/deletion is a common scenario in any communication setup.

### User Objectives and Goals

 - Model a system based on design equations and construct the same.
 - Measure the input and output to a system and work out a relation between the two.
 - Verify whether the system works as per the design.


### Pathway Activities - Experiment 2 :

 - The experiment set up consists of a Variable Regulated power supply and Dual power supply as blocks.
 - Connecting wires is also included to enable connections between the equipment.
